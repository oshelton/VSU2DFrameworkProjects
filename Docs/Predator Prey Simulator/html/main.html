Introduction</a></h2>
This project is a simple <a class="el" href="class_predator.html" title="Predator animal class.">Predator</a> <a class="el" href="class_prey.html" title="Clss that represents a Prey animal.">Prey</a> Simulator that is targeted towards fulfilling the requirements set forth in Dr. David Gibsons CS 4322 project 1 instructions. This project has been expanded to include several features not required in the original assignment such as:<p>
<ul>
<li>
Graphics that show the simulations progress and allows for navigating around the simulation's environment. </li>
<li>
GUI for controlling the simulation </li>
<li>
Dynamic simulation loading through script files. </li>
<li>
Animals have sight and hearing senses. </li>
<li>
Weight property added to create further detail in <a class="el" href="class_predator.html" title="Predator animal class.">Predator</a> and <a class="el" href="class_prey.html" title="Clss that represents a Prey animal.">Prey</a> relations. </li>
<li>
More options for <a class="el" href="class_animal.html" title="Basic Animal class, holds all fields and methods common to Predators and Prey.">Animal</a> Behavior State as given by the BehaviorState enumerator. </li>
<li>
Grouping of behaviors into behavior families that decide which behavior is associated with which BehaviorState. </li>
<li>
Variable simulation timing, to speed up or slow down the simulation. </li>
<li>
When any major event happens in the simulation it is recorded and written to a report when the simulation ends. </li>
</ul>

Design Patterns Used</a></h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="abstract">
Abstract Factory</a></h3>
The abstract factory pattern is used to manage the different Environments available in the simulation. The <a class="el" href="class_environment.html" title="Class responsible for creating animals.">Environment</a> class serves as the base factory class and all other types of Environments inherit from this class. The subclasses of <a class="el" href="class_environment.html" title="Class responsible for creating animals.">Environment</a> are used to group species of <a class="el" href="class_predator.html" title="Predator animal class.">Predator</a> and <a class="el" href="class_prey.html" title="Clss that represents a Prey animal.">Prey</a> into regions and can have a different background image associated with the subclass to one that may better fit the real word region the <a class="el" href="class_environment.html" title="Class responsible for creating animals.">Environment</a> represents. The <a class="el" href="class_environment.html" title="Class responsible for creating animals.">Environment</a> that is currently in use is kept track of in SimulationManager's currentEnvironment pointer and is switched whenever a simulation belonging to a different environment is loaded.<h3><a class="anchor" name="observe">
Observable</a></h3>
The Observable pattern is used in the <a class="el" href="class_prey_manager.html" title="Special class for mediating Prey/Predator relations.">PreyManager</a> and <a class="el" href="class_predator_manager.html" title="Special class for mediating Predator/Prey relations.">PredatorManager</a> classes. Predators can be registered as observers of the <a class="el" href="class_prey_manager.html" title="Special class for mediating Prey/Predator relations.">PreyManager</a> class and are updated once the <a class="el" href="class_prey_manager.html" title="Special class for mediating Prey/Predator relations.">PreyManager</a> has prepared its moved and state changed <a class="el" href="class_prey.html" title="Clss that represents a Prey animal.">Prey</a> lists. <a class="el" href="class_prey.html" title="Clss that represents a Prey animal.">Prey</a> are registered with the <a class="el" href="class_predator_manager.html" title="Special class for mediating Predator/Prey relations.">PredatorManager</a> in the same fashion.<h3><a class="anchor" name="fly">
Flyweight</a></h3>
The Flyweight pattern is used by the constructRenderable method of the <a class="el" href="class_animal.html" title="Basic Animal class, holds all fields and methods common to Predators and Prey.">Animal</a> class. This method is used to create the SimpleRenderable and LineRenderables used by Animals and the method is written in such a way that only one set of Renderables will be created for each seperate species of <a class="el" href="class_predator.html" title="Predator animal class.">Predator</a> and <a class="el" href="class_prey.html" title="Clss that represents a Prey animal.">Prey</a> thereby allowing all Predators and <a class="el" href="class_prey.html" title="Clss that represents a Prey animal.">Prey</a> of the same species to share the same renderables which helps performance.<p>
Another location this pattern is used in is the in the Behavior management of Animals. <a class="el" href="class_predator.html" title="Predator animal class.">Predator</a> and <a class="el" href="class_prey.html" title="Clss that represents a Prey animal.">Prey</a> Behavior families are built from the ground up to be shared and don't hold any concrete references to Animals tat use them.<p>
The Flyweight pattern is also used in <a class="el" href="class_animal.html" title="Basic Animal class, holds all fields and methods common to Predators and Prey.">Animal</a> behavior management as all animals of a species share the same PredatorbehaviorFamily or <a class="el" href="class_prey_behavior_family.html" title="Simple class used for grouping prey behaviors into a related group.">PreyBehaviorFamily</a>.<h3><a class="anchor" name="state">
State</a></h3>
In this project the state pattern is used to seperate <a class="el" href="class_animal.html" title="Basic Animal class, holds all fields and methods common to Predators and Prey.">Animal</a> behavior from <a class="el" href="class_animal.html" title="Basic Animal class, holds all fields and methods common to Predators and Prey.">Animal</a> properties, and as such Predators and <a class="el" href="class_prey.html" title="Clss that represents a Prey animal.">Prey</a> have no clue as to how they are being updated. This depends entirely on which <a class="el" href="class_predator_behavior_family.html" title="Simple class used for grouping predator behaviors into a related group.">PredatorBehaviorFamily</a> or <a class="el" href="class_prey_behavior_family.html" title="Simple class used for grouping prey behaviors into a related group.">PreyBehaviorFamily</a> they are using and what their current BehaviorState is. </div>
